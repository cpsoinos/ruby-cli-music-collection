# Ruby CLI Music Collection App

This is a small command-line application written in Ruby for managing an imaginary music collection. Uses the repository pattern, coupled with some syntactic sugar that resembles ActiveRecord queries and ActiveModel validations.

## Dependencies

Ruby. ðŸ˜Ž
(I used v2.6.0)

## Usage

    git clone https://github.com/cpsoinos/ruby-cli-music-collection.git myapp
    cd myapp
    # make `music` file executable
    chmod 775 music
    ./music

### Commands

- `add "$title" "$artist"`: adds an album to the collection with the given title and artist. All albums are unplayed by default.
- `play "$title"`: marks a given album as played.
- `show all`: displays all of the albums in the collection
- `show unplayed`: display all of the albums that are unplayed
- `show all by "$artist"`: shows all of the albums in the collection by the given artist
- `show unplayed by "$artist"`: shows the unplayed albums in the collection by the given artist
- `quit`: quits the program



### Running tests

- `ruby spec/album_spec.rb`: runs specs for the `Album` model
- `ruby spec/music_collection_spec.rb`: runs specs for the `MusicCollection` model
- `ruby spec/integration_spec.rb`: runs an integration spec, as if a user were inputting commands
